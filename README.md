# Barter Ecosystem
Barter is an open-source ecosystem of Rust libraries for building live-trading and back-testing systems. It is made up 
of several easy-to-use, extensible crates: 
* **Barter**: Framework for building event-driven live-trading and back-testing systems. Algorithmic trade with the 
peace of mind that comes from knowing your strategies have been back-tested with a near-identical trading engine.
* **Barter-Data**: High-performance WebSocket integration library for streaming public market data from leading 
cryptocurrency exchanges - batteries included. 
* **Barter-Execution**: Feature rich simulated exchange to assist with back-testing and dry-trading. Also provides a 
normalised trading interface capable of executing across different financial venues.
* **Barter-Integration**: Low-level frameworks for flexible REST/WebSocket integrations.
* **Barter-Macro**: Barter ecosystem macros. 

**See: [`Barter`], [`Barter-Data`], [`Barter-Integration`], [`Barter-Execution`] & [`Barter-Macro`] for more 
comprehensive documentation.**
