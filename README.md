# Barter
Barter is an algorithmic trading ecosystem of Rust libraries for building high-performance live-trading, paper-trading 
and back-testing systems.
* **Fast**: Written in native Rust. Minimal allocations. Data-oriented state management system with direct index lookups.
* **Robust**: Strongly typed. Thread safe. Extensive test coverage.
* **Customisable**: Plug and play Strategy and RiskManager components that facilitates most trading strategies (MarketMaking, StatArb, HFT, etc.).
* **Scalable**: Multithreaded architecture with modular design. Leverages Tokio for I/O. Memory efficient data structures.  

**See: [`Barter`], [`Barter-Data`], [`Barter-Instrument`], [`Barter-Execution`] & [`Barter-Integration`] for 
comprehensive documentation and examples for each library.**

## Overview
Barter is an algorithmic trading ecosystem of Rust libraries for building high-performance live-trading, paper-trading 
and back-testing systems. It is made up of several easy-to-use, extensible crates:
* **Barter**: Algorithmic trading Engine with feature rich state management system.
* **Barter-Instrument**: Exchange, Instrument and Asset data structures and utilities. 
* **Barter-Data**: Stream public market data from financial venues. Easily extensible via the MarketStream interface.
* **Barter-Execution**: Stream private account data and execute orders. Easily extensible via the ExecutionClient interface. 
* **Barter-Integration**: Low-level frameworks for flexible REST/WebSocket integrations.

## Notable Features
- Stream public market data from financial venues via the [`Barter-Data`] library. 
- Stream private account data, execute orders (live or mock)** via the [`Barter-Execution`] library.
- Plug and play Strategy and RiskManager components that facilitate most trading strategies. 
- Backtest utilities for efficiently running thousands of concurrent backtests.
- Flexible Engine that facilitates trading strategies that execute on many exchanges simultaneously.
- Use mock MarketStream or Execution components to enable back-testing on a near-identical trading system as live-trading.  
- Centralised cache friendly state management system with O(1) constant lookups using indexed data structures.
- Robust Order management system - use stand-alone or with Barter. 
- Trading summaries with comprehensive performance metrics (PnL, Sharpe, Sortino, Drawdown, etc.).
- Turn on/off algorithmic trading from an external process (eg/ UI, Telegram, etc.) whilst still processing market/account data. 
- Issue Engine Commands from an external process (eg/ UI, Telegram, etc.) to initiate actions (CloseAllPositions, OpenOrders, CancelOrders, etc.).
- EngineState replica manager that processes the Engine AuditStream to facilitate non-hot path monitoring components (eg/ UI, Telegram, etc.).

#### Paper Trading With Live Market Data & Mock Execution

```rust,no_run
const FILE_PATH_SYSTEM_CONFIG: &str = "barter/examples/config/system_config.json";
const RISK_FREE_RETURN: Decimal = dec!(0.05);

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialise Tracing
    init_logging();

    // Load SystemConfig
    let SystemConfig {
        instruments,
        executions,
    } = load_config()?;

    // Construct IndexedInstruments
    let instruments = IndexedInstruments::new(instruments);

    // Initialise MarketData Stream
    let market_stream = init_indexed_multi_exchange_market_stream(
        &instruments,
        &[SubKind::PublicTrades, SubKind::OrderBooksL1],
    )
    .await?;

    // Construct System Args
    let args = SystemArgs::new(
        &instruments,
        executions,
        LiveClock,
        DefaultStrategy::default(),
        DefaultRiskManager::default(),
        market_stream,
    );

    // Build & run full system:
    // See SystemBuilder for all configuration options
    let mut system = SystemBuilder::new(args)
        // Engine feed in Sync mode (Iterator input)
        .engine_feed_mode(EngineFeedMode::Iterator)

        // Audit feed is enabled (Engine sends audits)
        .audit_mode(AuditMode::Enabled)

        // Engine starts with TradingState::Disabled
        .trading_state(TradingState::Disabled)

        // Build System, but don't start spawning tasks yet
        .build::<EngineEvent, DefaultInstrumentMarketData, DefaultStrategyState, DefaultRiskManagerState>()?

        // Init System, spawning component tasks on the current runtime
        .init_with_runtime(tokio::runtime::Handle::current())
        .await?;

    // Take ownership of Engine audit receiver
    let audit_rx = system.audit_rx.take().unwrap();

    // Run dummy asynchronous AuditStream consumer
    // Note: you probably want to use this Stream to replicate EngineState, or persist events, etc.
    //  --> eg/ see examples/engine_sync_with_audit_replica_engine_state
    let audit_task = tokio::spawn(async move {
        let mut audit_stream = audit_rx.into_stream();
        while let Some(audit) = audit_stream.next().await {
            debug!(?audit, "AuditStream consumed AuditTick");
            if let EngineAudit::Shutdown(_) = audit.event {
                break;
            }
        }
        audit_stream
    });

    // Enable trading
    system.trading_state(TradingState::Enabled);

    // Let the example run for 5 seconds...
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;

    // Before shutting down, CancelOrders and then ClosePositions
    system.cancel_orders(InstrumentFilter::None);
    system.close_positions(InstrumentFilter::None);

    // Shutdown
    let (engine, _shutdown_audit) = system.shutdown().await?;
    let _audit_stream = audit_task.await?;

    // Generate TradingSummary<Daily>
    let trading_summary = engine
        .trading_summary_generator(RISK_FREE_RETURN)
        .generate(Daily);

    // Print TradingSummary<Daily> to terminal (could save in a file, send somewhere, etc.)
    trading_summary.print_summary();

    Ok(())
}

fn load_config() -> Result<SystemConfig, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let file = File::open(FILE_PATH_SYSTEM_CONFIG)?;
