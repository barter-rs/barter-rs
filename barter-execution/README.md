# Barter-Execution
High-performance and normalised trading interface capable of executing across many financial venues. Also provides 
a feature rich simulated exchange to assist with backtesting and dry-trading. 

**It is:**
* **Easy**: ExecutionClient trait provides a unified and simple language for interacting with exchanges.
* **Normalised**: Allow your strategy to communicate with every real or simulated exchange using the same interface.
* **Extensible**: Barter-Execution is highly extensible, making it easy to contribute by adding new exchange integrations!

## Related Projects
In addition to the Barter-Execution crate, the Barter project also maintains:
* [`Barter`]: High-performance, extensible & modular trading components with batteries-included. Contains a
  pre-built trading Engine that can serve as a live-trading or backtesting system.
* [`Barter-Integration`]: High-performance, low-level framework for composing flexible web integrations.
* [`Barter-Data`]: High-performance WebSocket integration library for streaming public market data from leading 
cryptocurrency exchanges.

## Roadmap
* Improve sophistication of the SimulatedExchange.
  * `OrderKind::Market` & `OrderKind::ImmediateOrCancel` execution support.
  * Enable many clients to use the exchange simultaneously, pathing the way for simulated order books generated by 
  many market archetype actors.
* Add many more `ExecutionClient` implementations for exchanges.
