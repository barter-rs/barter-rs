# Barter-Instrument
Barter-Instrument provides core data structures and utilities for handling exchanges, instruments, and assets.
These abstractions provide a structured and intuitive way to organize exchanges, assets, and instruments, ensuring they are represented in a way that best fits their characteristics and usage needs.

The Barter-Instrument crate also includes IndexedInstruments, a structured collection of exchanges, assets, and instruments designed for fast lookups. 

**See: [`Barter`], [`Barter-Data`], [`Barter-Execution`] & [`Barter-Integration`] for
comprehensive documentation of other Barter libraries.**

## Overview  

**Barter-Instrument** provides the core data structures and utilities needed to model **exchanges, instruments, and assets**, ensuring a structured and efficient way to represent and interact with them.  

### Asset  
Utilities for representing assets in a flexible manner.  

### Instrument  
A comprehensive instrument model that includes all the necessary data for **subscribing to market data** and **generating correct orders**.  

### Exchange  
A unique identifier representing an execution server.  

### IndexedInstruments  
A structured collection of **exchanges, assets, and instruments** optimized for **fast lookups**. By assigning unique identifiers to each entity, it enables **efficient, constant-time (`O(1)`) retrieval**, making it a critical component in other **Barter-related crates** that require quick access to financial data. This indexing system **reduces computational overhead** and enhances the organization of financial data.
